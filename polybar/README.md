# Polybar
To install this, just move config.ini to `$HOME/.config/polybar/config.ini`.

## launch.sh
This is a dependency for my i3wm dotfile. I used this file during tests. It does not have to exist, and realistically, I should probably get rid of it already, but it is here.

You don't need to run it if you just want to run polybar. You can get rid of this as long as you adapt i3's configs accordingly (execute polybar directly instead of running this).
