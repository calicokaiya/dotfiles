A shell prompt is the bit on a shell with the intent of showing you that you can insert commands.

### Customizing
Everytime you press enter, the prompt picks an element from the "faces" array to use as a part of the prompt.

This file comes with 3 sample lists that you can use. Feel free to expand this as you see fit.
